# Fetch++

Thanks for checking out <i>fetch++</i>!

It combines two powerful SDKs <i>fetch</i> and <i>json</i>, equipping C++ developers with a powerful native HTTP client for integration with REST APIs.

# Setup
1. Open the project in VS Code and navigate to the integrated terminal
2. Ensure you have Node v18+ installed by running `node -v`
3. Run `npm install`
4. Open the project in Xcode
5. Click `Command + B` on the keyboard to build the project for the first time

## Build
1. Click `Command + ,` to open Settings, click <i>Locations</i> in the sidebar, and click the arrow (->) under <i>Derived Data</i>
2. A new Finder window will open at Xcode’s <i>Derived Data</i> directory; find your project's name and expand Build > Product > Debug
3. Launch Terminal and type `cd` + Space
4. Navigate back to Finder, click and drag the <i>Debug</i> folder into Terminal, and click Enter
5. Click Command + N to open a new window or Command + T to open a new tab
6. Type `cd` + Space once more, drag your project's root directory into the new Terminal session, and click Enter
7. In the same Terminal session, execute the following command:<br><br>
<i>* You will have to execute the command every time you modify the C++ code</i>
```
xcodebuild -project fetch-json.xcodeproj -scheme fetch-json
```
8. Navigate back to Xcode and click Command + M to minimize the window

## Run
### Test Server

1. Navigate to VS Code's integrated terminal
2. Execute the following command:
```
node test-server/src/index.js
```

### Command-Line Application
1. Navigate to the first Terminal window
2. Execute the following command:
```
./fetch-json [-l | --log] # none, some, or more (optional --tls for TLS logging)
```

The test server is for your convenience getting started, however Fetch++ is feature-rich, including robust transport layer security, so you can access almost any resource on the internet.

## Reference

By default, the http_client executes synchronously. Request headers are mutated by the fetch API, therefore they must be passed by reference. The API can accept either string or JSON arguments.

```
fetch::http_client http;
fetch::header::map headers;

std::string url = "http://localhost:8080/api/greeting";

try {
    http.options(headers, url);

    unique_ptr<object> body = make_unique<object>((vector<object*>) {
            new object("firstName", encode("fetch++"))
        });
    
    auto response = http.post(headers, url, body.get());
    auto json = response.json();

    logger.info(decode(json->value()));
} catch (fetch::error& e) {
    throw e;
}
```
